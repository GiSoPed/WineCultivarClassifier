# Wine Cultivar Classifier
Used machine learning classification models (KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression) and a neural network to analyze thirteen chemical constituents of Italian wines in order to classify them into three cultivars. This project used sklearn, pandas, imblearn, matplotlib. The models of best fit for this project were the SVM and Logistic Regression models, both with accuracies of 97%.
